This is a forked project with prebuilt back-end API and front-end html/css code. All work is based on technical and functional specifications provided by the project lead. Server for API simulated with Node.js.

I am integrating the provided back-end data with the prebuilt front-end HTML/CSS by using Javascript to insert dynamic content. No libaries or frameworks used, only vanilla Javascript. 


## Original Readme.md Text ##

This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
